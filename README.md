Just creating a separate repository for a script that took me a *long* time to create.

You can use 'file_picker.py' to bring up an ncurses file picker onscreen and allows
a user to pick a number of files and prints the results (line separated) to the terminal
for use in scripts. Currently I am re-writing this in Go (and also C? though not quite
so successfully...).
